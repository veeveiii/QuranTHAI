QuranTHAI - Generic scripture reader Android app
===============================

QuranTHAI is a **generic scripture reader Android app** (for huge text in the UTF-8 text formatted with chapter:verse). Sample data is from a Thai Quran translation.

All data is stored in specially structured assets/data folder - designed to store are make easy-load-to-mem possible for both j2me and android - there are data index and key files too - all generated by the **[qth_parser](https://github.com/ykasidit/qth_parser)** sister project.

Generally, we take a huge text file containing lines of "verses" in the format that qth_parser sucessfully parses and generates the "data" folder with all the files, then we put that "data" folder into this "assets" folder. Then we use/customize this application to read (mainly in VerseLoader.java) and display that "data".
